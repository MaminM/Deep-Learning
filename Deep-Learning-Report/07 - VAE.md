# Task 1 - MNIST generation using VAE and GAE

## VAE

latent dimension = 10
MSE = 0.0118
IS = 7.289855

## GAN

IS = 8.112853

- No signs of model collapse
![[GAN.mp4 ]]




# Task 2: Quantitative vs Qualitative

## Quantitative
As confirmed, they are very similar
MAE (Trained MAE): 0.0449
MAE (Trained cGAN): 0.0458

## Qualitative

To do:
- Discuss based on ==GAN theory== how the qualitative results below give another dimension into finding what model is better
- Include figure in the appendix
